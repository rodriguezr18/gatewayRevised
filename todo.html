      <p>Kochi Castle is one of just twelve Japanese castles to have survived the fires, wars and other catastrophes of
        the post feudal age. The castle used to be the seat of the Yamauchi lords, who ruled over the surrounding
        region, then known as Tosa,
        during the Edo Period. The castle buildings have since been designated "important cultural properties", and now
        house local treasures and historical objects. Kochi Castle is located a short walk from Kochijo-mae tram stop.

      <p>This is a restaurant specializing in Awaodori chicken that was raised in a nature-rich environment. The
        signature menu item is the Awaodori Barayaki, where the chicken breast meat with the rib meat still attached is
        cooked over charcoal, trapping
        its savory taste. They make sure the whole chicken can be savored, such as by taking dashi (broth) from the
        chicken bones and searing or cooking parts like the liver.</p><br>
